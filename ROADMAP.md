Roadmap for the project

* Project task:
  design and implement a regression model to predict the age of the healthy subjects from brain data. You can compare the performance of different regression models, including traditional machine learning and deep learning models. You can evaluate the variability of the prediction performance across different acquisition sites (if this information is available). Suitable datasets: a dataset of structural brain features computed from MRI scans of subjects of the ABIDE dataset is made available within the course materials: DATASET/FEATURES/Brain_MRI_FS_ABIDE/FS_features_ABIDE_males.csv

* Project Milestones:
  - [x] Neural network code (python) with global features as input
  - [ ] Hyperparameter optimization for the neural network
  - [x] Linear regression code (python) with global features as input
  - [ ] Finding different regression models
  - [ ] Comparison between the regression models, regarding global features
  - [ ] Evaluating the performance for local features, changing acquisition site
  - [ ] Comparing the performance across different acquisition sites
